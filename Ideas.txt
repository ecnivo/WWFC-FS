-----Primary goals:-----
	Get the Twitter flight status

-----Ask again:-----
	Relevant limiting weather
	When it was last updated
	What does the flight status mean?
	Full weather
	TAF parsing
	
-----Additional goals:-----
	Likelihood of flying at a certain time (in the future?)
	Call WWFC
	Messenger bot

-----Development plan.-----
	Google Assistant
	Dialogflow
	G-Cloud Functions
*		How to host a server?
			[DEPRECATED] Multi threaded Python? For the server for multiple requests
			[DEPRECATED] Python SSL (HTTPS?)
		[SOOOOO DEPRECATED] Test server/service with simple commands Create a client & server on the same machine
		Create JSON parsing / replying fulfiller
		Eventually mirror Github to Cloud Source Repo
	Twitter
		Get a damn API key I guess
		Tweepy / scraping?
	Navcanada
		Scraping? API for weather?

-----Communication protocol-----
Next steps: Focus on sending "contexts" back and forth, with bits of information (eg. when the time was updated, or what the status is, or what the weather conditions are), and letting dialogflow handle the speech formulation bits
